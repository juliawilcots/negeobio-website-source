## Registration

#### Registration is now closed. See you on April 16!  

In order to attend NE Geobio (or any event at MIT), you **must be fully vaccinated** against COVID-19, including a booster shot.

We are hosting a **one-day, in-person** event at MIT. Talks and posters will be indoors in a large space; social events that include food (breakfast, coffee breaks, dinner) will be outdoors, weather permitting.
