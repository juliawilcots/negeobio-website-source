## Registration

#### Registration is open until March 1, 2022 using [this form](https://forms.gle/equAjZaPSRAMfTKV8).  

In order to attend NE Geobio (or any event at MIT), you **must be fully vaccinated** against COVID-19, including a booster shot. You will be asked to upload proof of vaccination (or an approved exception) to MIT's "Tim Ticket" system as we get closer to the conference.  

As of January 10, 2022, we are planning to host a **one-day, in-person** event at MIT. Talks and posters will be indoors in a large space; social events that include food (breakfast, coffee breaks, dinner) will be outdoors, weather permitting. If the COVID-19 situation worsens or MIT changes its policies surrounding events, we will pivot to a virtual conference similar to the 2021 Dartmouth-hosted NE Geobio Conference.
