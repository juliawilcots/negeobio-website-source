## Code of Conduct

The Northeast Geobiology Symposium should be a place where all members of our community feel safe and included. As organizers, we hope to foster a collaborative, welcoming, and respectful environment. Behavior that prevents this from happening will not be tolerated.  

Audio and video recording, or taking images of a presentation without the presentersâ€™ permission, is expressly forbidden. Images of posters taken without permission are not allowed. Images of posters may be taken with the explicit consent of the presenter, and images may be acquired only in the presence of the presenter.  

By registering for the Symposium, you agree to:  
- Treat all participants with respect   
- Abide by all COVID protocols   
- Be considerate, collegial, and collaborative  
- Communicate civilly, critiquing ideas rather than individuals and avoiding personal attacks  
- Notify meeting organizers if you observe someone in distress, notice a potentially dangerous situation, or witness an event that endangers safety or breaks this code of conduct  

Unacceptable behavior includes, but is not limited to:  
- Harassment, intimidation, or bullying  
- Discrimination  
- Physical or verbal abuse  

Examples of unacceptable behavior include, but are not limited to:  
- Verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, national origin.  
- Inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images in public spaces or in presentations.  
- Intentional, uninvited physical contact of any form.  
- Threats (implied or real) of physical, professional or financial harm.  

Consequences of unacceptable behavior:
- Anyone requested to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to immediately cease and desist.  
- If unacceptable behavior continues, meeting organizers may institute actions including immediate removal from the meeting.  

Reporting unacceptable behavior:  

If you are the subject of unacceptable behavior or have witnessed any such behavior, please immediately notify a meeting organizer in-person or by email.

Anyone experiencing or witnessing behavior that constitutes an immediate or serious threat to public safety, or a criminal act is expected to call 911 or, if on campus, the MIT Police (at (617) 253-1212). Those witnessing a potential criminal act should also take actions necessary to maintain their own personal safety.
