The Northeast Geobiology Symposium is a student- and postdoc-organized conference designed to bring geobiologists from across the Northeastern US and Canada together for an inclusive conference. NE Geobio strives to be a welcoming place where scientists at various career states can learn from one another and develop collaborative relationships for future work. Undergraduate and graduate students are encouraged to apply to present their research, and we aim to give everyone who wants to present the opportunity to do so. NE Geobio is free to attend and, this year, will occur over one day only, to eliminate the cost and COVID concerns of an overnight stay in Cambridge, MA.

We gratefully acknowledge the generous support from (our sponsors)....

The organizing committee,

Noah Anderson, Diana Dumit, Ellen Lalk, Angel Mojarro, and Julia Wilcots, Jack Payette, and Kristin Bergmann
