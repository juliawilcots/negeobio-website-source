## MIT Covid Policies

We are following all of [MIT's policies](https://now.mit.edu/policies/events/) regarding COVID-19. In order to attend this conference, you must be fully vaccinated against COVID-19, including a booster shot. You will be asked to upload proof of vaccination (or an approved exemption) via MIT's ["Tim Ticket"](http://covidapps.mit.edu/visitors) system as we get closer to the symposium (stay tuned!). The City of Cambridge and MIT both have indoor mask mandates -- everyone must be masked at all times while indoors.

## Additional considerations

We are planning a one-day NE Geobio Symposium this year in order to give folks the option of driving to and from Cambridge in the same day, avoiding an overnight stay. Weather permitting, we will have food and drinks available outdoors, while poster sessions and talks will occur in a large indoor space.
